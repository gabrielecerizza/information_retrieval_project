    "description": "For each target word we provide the Jensen Shannon Distance score and a list containing (usually) the top 3 sentences for each discovered sense of the word. The number of sentences for each sense is shown in 'senses_counts', while the frequencies are shown in 'senses_freqs'. So, the first list of three sentences in the list of target sentences refers to the sentences of the first sense (or sense 0) and so on. Sense -1 is noise, so no sentence is provided. The words in 'one_epoch_target_words' were found only in one corpus, either the old or the new one. The words in 'hdbscan_errors' could not be processed due to errors generated by HDBSCAN. The words in 'memory_issues' could not be processed due to eccessive memory demands. The tags appended to the words have the following meaning: 'aj' is an adjective; 'nn' is a noun; 'vb' is a verb; 'pn' is a proper noun. The target words are sorted by score.",
